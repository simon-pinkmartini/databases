- hexagons and bookshelves, book covers are like memory on a HD
- signs themselves mean nothing, unless we attach meaning to them
- the combination of letters is finite, but the possible meanings attached to them are infinite
- data is fuzzy, it can have the same meaning even if it differs in the details
- possibility of organzing the data hierarchically, in structured way

Connections between Jose Luis Borges, "The Library of Babel" and Michael Castelle, "Relational and Non-Relational Models in the Entextualization of Bureaucracy"

1) Both texts are concerned with the problem of organizing information. For us as human beings, this is a very essential process. Our existence depends on our ability to organize "stuff" into structures. As we watch the world around us, live our lives and interact with each other, we constantly create information about people, objects, places or events. We connect this information to other information and we memorize it in order to retrieve it later. The big question both texts explore is how this process basic process works and how it changes as our primary information processing technology advances - from spoken language to written books and complex machines. Jose Luis Borges imagines a library of an (in-)finite number of books, organized in shelves and hexagonal rooms, connected by things like references, catalogs, and even catalogues of catalogues. His fictional essay touches on similar topics as Michael Castelles academic sociological: Is it possible to organize all information in the world in a systematic way? What are the preconditions of imposing a "bureaucratic" order, what are the merits of this technique and where are the limits?

2) Organizing information requires a set of techniques to store and retrieve data. A point Castelles makes in his paper is that the way we structure data depends on the properties of our technology: whether we use relational databases (with tables, primary keys and crosstables) or "network type" databases (which seem to be organized around processes) depends on the speed and order with which we can access a medium like tape (where the first bits of information are accessed first and the last bits last) or on a computer chip (where bits of information can be accessed in any order). As he sketches out the architecture of his library, Borges evokes a similar idea, namely, that the form of our knowledge somehow depends on its storage, which in case of the library is given by books, shelves and rooms of identical size and structure. He plays with the fact that in the alphabet, there is a finite set of letters (25 characters, including dots and commas) and there is only so much you can say with these symbols.

3) While a particular technology helps us to organize data and process information, it necessarily also limits our thinking and actions. This becomes clear, as Borges discusses the codes used in his library's books. How do we know, what language a particular book was written in? How can we be sure of the real meanings of particular words and sentences? Does it matter in which order we read the different books? As Borges hovers around these questions, he keeps on referring to the concept of "infinity". We can understand this reference as a recognition of the fact that there whatever information technology we are using, we will never be able to represent our world in its totality. It is the process of organizing "stuff" into structures itself that necessarily creates voids and leaves out possibilities. The limits imposed by particular data structures become obvious if we imagine someone trying to "order" the internet into a catalogue (as web portals in the 90s used to do) or to "fill" the whole internet into a relational database: The tasks go way beyond the possibilities that these structures offer. It thus becomes comprehensible that the advent of the internet with its endless sets of connections and interlinkages could indeed signal the end of the bureaucratic era as defined by Castelle.
